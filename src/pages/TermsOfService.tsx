          <div className="space-y-6">
            <p>Welcome to the ProBound Terms of Service (these "Terms") for the website (the "Website"), its subdomains, and associated APIs, operated by OSOP Corporation ("ProBound", "we", or "us"). The Website and any content, tools, features, and functionality offered on or through the Website – including our AI-driven voice agent platform that creates synthesized audio and voice models from recordings, text, video, and other content you provide – are collectively referred to as the "Services."</p>

            <p>The Services utilize advanced artificial intelligence ("AI") tools to generate output audio and voice content, including experimental features that may still be under development. Because AI technology is continually evolving, we cannot guarantee that every generated audio output will meet your requirements. You assume full responsibility for your use of the Services, including any text or voice inputs you provide ("Your Inputs"), the resulting generated audio ("Your Outputs"), and any subsequent distribution of that content.</p>

            <p>By accessing and using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and any additional policies referenced herein (such as our Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Services. For users accessing the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

            <p>Arbitration Notice: Section 8 below contains an arbitration clause and a waiver of class action rights. If you do not agree to these provisions, please do not use the Services. You may opt out in accordance with the instructions provided in Section 8.6.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">1. Who May Use the Services</h2>
            <p>To use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction and be legally capable of forming a binding contract. If you are using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You agree that you will not access or use the Services if prohibited by applicable law.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">2. User Accounts, Subscriptions, and Free Trials</h2>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.1 Creating and Safeguarding Your Account</h3>
            <p>To access certain features of the Services, you must create an account ("Account") or link an existing account (e.g., via GitHub or Google). When you register, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your Account and for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. Please notify us immediately at security@probound.ai if you suspect any unauthorized use or breach of your Account. If we have previously suspended or terminated your access, you agree not to re-register unless expressly permitted by us.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.2 Subscription Payment</h3>
            <p>If you subscribe to a paid tier of the Services, you agree to pay all applicable fees and taxes in U.S. Dollars. Payment details must be provided directly to our designated Payment Service Provider. You acknowledge that:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription period at the prevailing rates.</li>
              <li>Failure to pay the applicable fees may result in the termination of your access to the Services.</li>
              <li>We reserve the right to modify subscription fees or adjust pricing at any time upon reasonable notice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.3 Payment Provider Terms</h3>
            <p>We use third-party payment processors (for example, Stripe, Inc.) to handle transactions. By providing your payment information, you agree to be bound by the terms and privacy policies of our payment service provider, and you consent to the sharing of necessary payment details with such third parties solely for processing your payment.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.4 Subscription Renewals and Cancellations</h3>
            <p>Unless canceled in advance of the renewal date, your subscription will renew automatically, and your designated payment method will be charged for the subsequent subscription period. To cancel your subscription, please follow the cancellation instructions available in your account settings or contact support@probound.ai.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.5 No Subscription Refunds</h3>
            <p>Except as expressly provided herein, payments for subscriptions are nonrefundable. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the Services until the end of your current billing cycle.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.6 Free Trials</h3>
            <p>If offered a free trial for a paid tier of the Services, your trial period will begin upon registration and last for the period specified in the trial confirmation. Should you not cancel before the trial expires, you authorize us to convert your trial into a paid subscription. If you cancel during the trial, any data associated with your trial Account may be deleted at our discretion.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2.7 Promotional Codes</h3>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">7. Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability, and Indemnification</h2>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">7.1 Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>Your use of the Services is at your own risk. The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. ProBound does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">7.2 Limitations of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, ProBound and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use of the Services. In any event, ProBound’s total liability for any claim shall not exceed the greater of (i) the total fees paid by you in the past six months for the Services or (ii) a specified nominal amount (e.g., $100).</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">7.3 Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ProBound and its affiliates from and against any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from or related to your breach of these Terms, violation of any rights of third parties, or misuse of the Services.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">8. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">8.1 Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
            <p>In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, you agree to first attempt to resolve the matter through informal negotiations. If a resolution cannot be reached within thirty (30) days, any dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration provider (e.g., JAMS) in accordance with its rules. Arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis only; class actions or representative proceedings are not permitted.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">8.2 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning small claims (within the jurisdictional limits of a small claims court), injunctive relief, or certain intellectual property disputes may be resolved in court.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">8.3 Costs of Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Unless prohibited by law, each party shall bear its own costs of arbitration. If arbitration fees are found to be prohibitively expensive, the arbitrator may order that ProBound cover the necessary expenses to avoid undue hardship.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">8.4 Opt-Out</h3>
            <p>If you prefer not to be bound by these arbitration provisions, you may opt out by sending written notice to support@probound.ai within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services. (Opting out of arbitration does not affect your waiver of the right to participate in class actions.)</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">9. Additional Provisions</h2>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">9.1 International Use</h3>
            <p>The Services are controlled and operated from within the United States. If you access the Services from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">9.2 Updates to These Terms</h3>
            <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The "Last Revised" date at the top of this document will be updated accordingly. Significant changes will be communicated via email or a prominent notice on the Website, but your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">9.3 Termination</h3>
            <p>ProBound reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account and access to the Services immediately if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, all licenses granted to you will cease, though provisions that by their nature should survive termination will continue to apply.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">9.4 Injunctive Relief</h3>
            <p>A breach of these Terms may cause irreparable harm to ProBound. In such cases, ProBound shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies without the need to post a bond or prove actual damages.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">9.5 Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflict of laws principles. Any legal actions or proceedings arising out of or related to these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the appropriate state or federal courts located in Delaware.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">9.6 Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms, along with any rights and licenses granted herein, may be assigned by ProBound but may not be assigned by you without our prior written consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.</p>
